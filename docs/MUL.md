♐MUL is a series of 3979 videos that was uploaded to the twitter account
on March 27 to March 29, 2016. It is the fifth series posted in the
twitter account. It began twelve hours after the end of the
♐[CAB](CAB "wikilink") series on twitter and immediately after
♐[WINGSET](WINGSET "wikilink") was posted to the youtube channel.
(♐[RETIO](RETIO "wikilink") was posted to youtube while this series
was in progress, and ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink") would be posted on
youtube about six hours after ♐MUL ended on twitter). At 4096 videos,
this series is four times as large as ♐[CAB](CAB "wikilink").

Like ♐[CAB](CAB "wikilink"), the videos in this series differ from the
"classic" UFSC style: they are three to five seconds, and the [Unknown
Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") has been replaced by a series of
static-y bursts.

## Audible binary

[It has been
postulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4ckhrf/all_mul_videos/)
that these contain 19 different audio-encoded binary bytes, as in
♐[CAB](CAB "wikilink"), but work on this is incomplete.

## Possible meanings of name

[It has been
noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4c6sct/new_series_mul_has_no_more_spoken_letters/)
that MUL is Sumerian for "star". (See [Babylonian star
catalogues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_star_catalogues)).
