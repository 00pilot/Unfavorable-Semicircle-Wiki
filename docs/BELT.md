# BELT

⊕BELT is series that was uploaded to [Stabilitory newing](Stabilitory_newing "wikilink"). ⊕BELT 0 was posted on May 17,
2017 (the same day as ♐[RATE](RATE "wikilink") was posted). The series
ended with ⊕BELT 24, posted on June 1, 2017. ♐[BRING](BRING "wikilink")
was posted on the main channel the next day.

Unlike ⊕[BROTHER](BROTHER "wikilink"), there does not yet seem to be a
"counterpart" for this series — although the main channel's ♐BROTHER
didn't start until nearly three weeks after Stabilitory newing's series
began.

## Description of videos

⊕BELT videos are 6:10 (370 seconds) in length with a with a shifting
"[histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)" effect, similar
to other stabilitory newing videos.

### Audio analysis

  - The audio for ⊕BELT videos is in a stereo track, with "chirping
    robot" type sounds similar to other stabilitory newing videos. In
    most cases, the left channel has a louder signal, with a
    quieter/degraded/modified version in the right channel. Sometimes
    the sounds are more musical (similar to a glitchy chiptunes effect),
    and sometimes more like a data transmission.
  - Many of the audio tracks include extensive use of some sort of [half wave rectification](http://www.visionics.a.se/html/curriculum/Experiments/HW%20Rectifier/Half%20Wave%20Rectifier1.html)
    effect on the audio, removing most of the negative samples.
  - The audio is often similar overall, and many videos re-use the exact
    same audio track from a previous one, including:
      - ⊕BELT 0, 7, 11, 17, 21
      - ⊕BELT 1, 3, 13
      - ⊕BELT 2, 8, 12
      - ⊕BELT 4, 20, 23, 24
      - ⊕BELT 5, 10
      - ⊕BELT 6, 18 (*special case; see below*)
      - ⊕BELT 9, 22

(Therefore, from BELT 0 to 24 inclusive only 14, 15, 16 and 19 have
unique audio)

⊕BELT 6 & 18 are a special case: they have what appears to be identical
audio, but shifted from each other by a few samples in some parts.
Therefore, they do not invert/cancel cleanly.

## Significance of name & possible relationship to other UFSC videos

  - "belt" has some astronomical connotations (asteroid belts, the
    Kuiper Belt, Orion's Belt, etc.)
  - [Belt problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_problem) are a
    specific type of math problem dealing with belts and pulleys
  - in antiquity, belts were used in cryptography along with
    [scytales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale) to create a code
    similar to a Caesar cipher.

## Composites

No composites have been attempted for stabilitory newing videos.
(*although see [these notes](Investigation_into_color_data_in_SN_visuals "wikilink") on an
effort to extract data from Stabilitory newing visuals.*)
