# OR

OR is a short series of videos that were posted on the original youtube
account on August 8, 2015. They were also the last videos posted before
a four-month gap in posting. (This was, at the time, the longest known
gap between posts.) The preceding video posted was
♐[LOCK](LOCK "wikilink"), and the following video (posted in December)
was ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink"). The videos are notable for being one
of the exceptional videos on the channel.

There were only four videos in the series:

  - [OR\_101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7QrAlGgxkA), 1 minute (60
    seconds) long;
  - [OR\_1601](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbH3QphfEKE), 16 minutes
    (960 seconds) long;
  - [OR\_10001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuJ7SZhDgyE), 1 hour
    (3600 seconds) long; and
  - [OR\_110001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESVqEQB6OVU), 11 hours
    (39600 seconds) long.

## Meaning of titles

The significance of the operator "OR" in the titles is unclear.

The numbers in the titles can be interpreted as the lengths of the
videos: "1:01," "16:01," "1:00:01," and "11:00:01."

## Characteristics of OR videos

The OR videos are unusual in several respects:

  - They are silent;
  - They all contain the same still image (orange pixels in a black
    grid); and
  - The filenames do not have the preceding "♐" symbol.

## Unusual playback behavior

A strange effect was discovered on certain TVs that played any of the videos:

On December 2021, Discord user `Stekapinko` uploaded a video, along with this comment (referring to *♐OR_101*):

> hey i just found this server from a video about unfavorable semicircle and looked at the archives of it. I looked at a video called "RETIO" and saw that my phone saw something different than my pc
> 
> the same goes for [this video](OR-101-mobile-playback.mp4)

This behavior is possibly related to memory glitches from [Stagefright exploits](UFSC,_Stagefright_and_Rowhammer_exploits "wikilink").
