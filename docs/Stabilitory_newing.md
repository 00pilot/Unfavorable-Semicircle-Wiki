## Work on finding information in the visuals

[Notes on some ideas on treating the "histograms" as a source of data.](http://www.unfavorablesemicircle.com/wiki/Investigation_into_color_data_in_SN_visuals)

## Removal

The Twitter account was deleted (apparently by the author(s)

the time ♐[RESET\_STRANGE\_YD](RESET_STRANGE_YD "wikilink") was
uploaded.
