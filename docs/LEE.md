# LEE

♐LEE is a series of videos that was uploaded to the twitter account
between March 18 and March 24, 2016. It is the third series posted in
the twitter account, following ♐[EL](EL "wikilink") and
♐[RIA](RIA "wikilink"). The last video posted was ♐LEE 16323, although
it appears there were some numbers skipped while posting. In any case,
only 7,653 videos have been archived.

The videos in this series are in the "classic" UFSC style, three second
long videos, with frames of a single color and the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") saying a letter or number. [It has been
noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4bcpvc/strange_jump_to_lee_11123_after_the_upload_gap/)
that this series included longer pauses while uploading, as well as
numerical leaps in the numbered videos.

This series is semi-preserved, and some of the videos have been scraped
and are available
[here](https://mega.nz/#!5mxEmYjC!0WxgvJI89QMw9CZl8vnPVh42CwNpIDr2J_We4gS9RG8).
A composite has been made of the available videos.
