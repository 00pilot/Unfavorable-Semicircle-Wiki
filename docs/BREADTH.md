## Overview

♐BREADTH is series of two videos uploaded to the second YouTube account. ♐BREADTH 0 was posted on December 5, 2016 (the day after ♐[FOLD](FOLD "wikilink") was posted). ♐BREADTH 1 was posted on December 6, 2016 (the day before ♐[STEM](STEM "wikilink") was posted).

This series is noteworthy for its role in the discovery of [3-D Composites](3D_Composite "wikilink").

## Description of videos

The videos are approximately 7:18:06 in length and contain a series of
rapidly-flashing frames.

The videos have a silent stereo audio track.

## Possible relationship to other UFSC videos

* "breadth" seems clearly conceptually related to ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") (and, following on that logic, ♐[SLIM](SLIM "wikilink") may be a stand-in for the third dimension.)
* another form of this same word was used for the name of the ♐[BROAD](BROAD "wikilink") series.

## Composites

### 2-D Composites

*♐BREADTH composite by thomasf (**n.b.**: image uploaded to this wiki as a jpg due to file size restrictions)*

* this composite was made at 1000 pixels in width; it is assumed that there is no "correct" width as the important data is in the 3-D composite.

### 3-D Composite

* as a [3-D Composite](3D_Composite "wikilink"), BREADTH forms an atom-like shape with nested spheres of increasingly higher density, and 3 disks surrounding them. View in tomasf's composite viewer: <http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/stl.html?path=BREADTH_composite3D.stl>
