♐BREADTH is series of two videos uploaded to the second YouTube account.
♐BREADTH 0 was posted on December 5, 2016 (the day after
♐[FOLD](FOLD "wikilink") was posted). ♐BREADTH 1 was posted on
December 6, 2016 (the day before ♐[STEM](STEM "wikilink") was posted).

This series is noteworthy for its role in the discovery of [3-D Composites](3D_Composite "wikilink").

## Description of videos

The videos are approximately 7:18:06 in length and contain a series of
rapidly-flashing frames.

The videos have a silent stereo audio track.

## Possible relationship to other UFSC videos

  - "breadth" seems clearly conceptually related to
    ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") (and, following on that logic,
    ♐[SLIM](SLIM "wikilink") may be a stand-in for the third
    dimension.)
  - another form of this same word was used for the name of the
    ♐[BROAD](BROAD "wikilink") series.

## Composites

### 2-D Composites

*♐BREADTH composite by thomasf (**n.b.**: image uploaded to this wiki as
a jpg due to file size restrictions)*

  - this composite was made at 1000 pixels in width; further
    investigation is needed to find the "right" width.

### 3-D Composite

  - as a [3-D Composite](3D_Composite "wikilink"), BREADTH forms an
    atom-like shape with nested spheres of increasingly higher density,
    and 3 disks surrounding them. View in tomasf's composite viewer:
