## Audio

The audio track has a warbling, low-frequency sound with data noises.
The final 96 seconds look like a silent waveform, but as discovered by
discord user Unstable Olding, "there is a lot of static/wind noise if
you amplify it".

## Composites

### 2-D Composite

(*composite by discord user its a-me markio*)

The composite had blue "islands" over a magenta background. It has been
noted by Discord user unfavorablist that the image under that looks like
a slice of the "hair/grass" filaments in the ♐[RUN](RUN "wikilink")
composite.

The hairs are most visible in the red channel of the image (as
discovered by discord user crispyLettuce). Removing the other color
channels makes the curves more clear:

Discord user Raketemensch has noted that ♐GEN's 2-D composite looks like
a cloud chamber photo (or, similarly, a [bubble chamber](https://imgur.com/gallery/8uR3GK0/)).

### 3-D Composite
