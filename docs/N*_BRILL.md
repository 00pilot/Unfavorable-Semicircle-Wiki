was also around this time that the twitter account was launched.)

videos, it contains (possibly deliberately-encoded) errors that cause
playback difficulties in some platforms.

Reddit user /u/Cybernetic\_Overlord
[believes](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4b3y3r/its_all_one_big_song/)
that ♐N\* BRILL points to Unfavorable Semicircle's videos being heavily
encrypted music. When sped up, ♐N\* BRILL shows evidence of containing a
[repeating rhythm](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4akyno/n_brill_rhythmic_beats/).
The same user [claims to have shown](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4aq0qa/n_brill_is_all_the_brill_videos_combined/)
that ♐N\* BRILL may actually contain all the beats of every video in the
♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") series, although no peer review has occurred
to lend or take away credibility from this.

## Relationship to [BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") series

It is stated by Discord user tomasf that this video is "basically just
the first 5000 frames of [BRILL](BRILL "wikilink")".
