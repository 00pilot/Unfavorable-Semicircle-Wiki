FEND is a series posted to the [second YouTube account](Real_and_Fake_channels "wikilink") between May 26 and June 4,
2016. There are 20 videos in the series (numbered 0 - 19).

## Details

Through videos all have an identical length of 27:46, for a total of
about 50,000 frames per video.

The composites made from the videos are generally color gradients.

## Composites

### 2-D Composite

Composite by tomasf: <http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/FEND_composite.png>
; it is a long image with several colored bars.

It is worth noting that one section near the beginning of the combined
gradient composite had an "island" like object in it:

### 3-D Composite

several planes crossing through each other with some mountain-like
shapes.

## Audio

The audio in the FEND videos (at least so far) can be divided into three
sub-groups. The sub-groups can be distinguished by their identical audio
content.

SUB-GROUP A is identified by a \~2s. scratching-type noise.

  - MEMBERS OF SUB-GROUP A = 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 15

SUB-GROUP B is identified by a \~1:27 "heartbeat" sound with a large DC
offset (\~ -.749)

  - MEMBERS OF SUB-GROUP B = 2, 4, 10, 11, 16, 17

SUB-GROUP C is identified by a \~20:18 throb/rumble sound with a large
DC offset (\~-.7275)

  - MEMBERS OF SUB-GROUP C = 5, 7, 9, 12, 14

### Method of Testing for Audio Similarity

For each of the groups, /u/Unfavorablist opened two separate FEND sound
tracks in [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/).
/u/Unfavorablist then inverted one and did a mix. Identical but inverted
tracks should cancel each other out perfectly, as these did.
