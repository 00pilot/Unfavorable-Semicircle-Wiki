# The Blind Men and The Elephant
by John Godfrey Saxe (1816–1887)

## I.

IT was six men of Indostan<br/>
To learning much inclined,<br/>
Who went to see the Elephant<br/>
(Though all of them were blind),<br/>
That each by observation<br/>
Might satisfy his mind.

## II.

The *First* approached the Elephant,<br/>
And happening to fall<br/>
Against his broad and sturdy side,<br/>
At once began to bawl:<br/>
"God bless me!—but the Elephant<br/>
Is very like a wall!"

## III.

The *Second*, feeling of the tusk,<br/>
Cried: "Ho!—what have we here<br/>
So very round and smooth and sharp?<br/>
To me 't is mighty clear<br/>
This wonder of an Elephant<br/>
Is very like a spear!"

## IV.

The *Third* approached the animal,<br/>
And happening to take<br/>
The squirming trunk within his hands,<br/>
Thus boldly up and spake:<br/>
"I see," quoth he, "the Elephant<br/>
Is very like a snake!"

## V.

The *Fourth* reached out his eager hand,<br/>
And felt about the knee.<br/>
"What most this wondrous beast is like<br/>
Is mighty plain," quoth he;<br/>
"'T is clear enough the Elephant<br/>
Is very like a tree!"

## VI.

The *Fifth*, who chanced to touch the ear,<br/>
Said: "E'en the blindest man<br/>
Can tell what this resembles most;<br/>
Deny the fact who can,<br/>
This marvel of an Elephant<br/>
Is very like a fan!"

## VII.

The *Sixth* no sooner had begun<br/>
About the beast to grope,<br/>
Than, seizing on the swinging tail<br/>
That fell within his scope,<br/>
"I see," quoth he, "the Elephant<br/>
Is very like a rope!"

## VIII.

And so these men of Indostan<br/>
Disputed loud and long,<br/>
Each in his own opinion<br/>
Exceeding stiff and strong,<br/>
Though each was partly in the right,<br/>
And all were in the wrong!

## MORAL.

So, oft in theologic wars<br/>
The disputants, I ween,<br/>
Rail on in utter ignorance<br/>
Of what each other mean,<br/>
*And prate about an Elephant<br/>
Not one of them has seen!*
