# Contributing to the wiki
**a step-by-step guide for dummies by @tukkek**

*Requirements: a web browser.*

1. If you don't already have one, [create a Github account](https://github.com/signup).
2. Login to your new or existing account.
3. Clone the [wiki repository](https://github.com/ufscwiki/Unfavorable-Semicircle-Wiki/) with the Fork button.
4. Now you have your own personal copy to work on, something like `https://github.com/USERNAME/Unfavorable-Semicircle-Wiki/`.
5. In your own copy, hit `Fetch upstream` and then `Fetch and merge`.
   * *This step is only necessary if you're coming back to a previously-created repository.*
6. In your own copy, enter the `docs` directory.
7. The wiki pages in this folder are written in Markdown, which you may want to [read up on](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
8. You can edit individual pages by clicking the files and then the `Edit` button (the pencil icon in the top right corner).
9. Edit the page's Markdown manually or copy-paste the file to an online Markdown editor (such as [this](https://stackedit.io/app) or [this](https://dillinger.io/)).
10. Once you're done, save the page by adding a "commit message" (short description of your changes to this file) and pressing `Commit changes`
    * *do not choose to create a new branch unless you're familiar with git workflow.*
12. Once you have edited one or more files and are ready to share the changes, go back to your repository's main page (*see step #4*), hit `Contribute` and then `Open pull request`.
13. On the next page, hit `Create pull request`, add a title (and optionally a longer description) then click `Create pull request` again to finish the process.
14. @Heraclitus Akimbo will review, apply and upload the changes, you may consider leaving a courtesy ping on Discord too as a heads-up.

If you have any questions post them on the Discord's #skill-share channel.
