## Transcriptions

Within this video, there is a single person or two people talking
together (there is debate as to which). Several redditors have made
efforts to transcribe them. Here are all the transcriptions.

### Fiddlerblue's transcription

"You \[stand on a - still are a\] stupid man.

The problem \[of a - is there\] somewhere.

(inaudible) \[stupid lie\].

(inaudible) \[when\] the direction is right,

\[what do you think will\] happen?

(inaudible) to \[be very - the very\] round.

\[Wake up\]. You’re wasting my time.

(inaudible) Do I frighten you?

\[He’s stuck up - That stuck up - That Somehow\](inaudible)\[episode -
so\]? <em>I really can't tell what he's saying here.</em>

The truth is (inaudible) allocated.

\[Such a lie is a - So much work for such a\] stupid thing.

\[Just set off the mine\] \[and watch it\] \[widget - would you\]"
<em>Again, can't really tell what he's saying here either.</em>

### thisiss transcription

\[inaudible - phonetically it sounds like "the fellow equipment"\]

"Will soon be frightened"

"That somehow a system is behind the code"

"The truth is \[...ently\] allocated"

"Such as \[i think it's "Lies" but it gets clipped and so it sounds like
another syllable in there\] and secrecy"

\[i can't understand this one either - but i think your translation is
phonetically accurate - maybe 'wish it' instead of 'watch it' - that
section is choppy and could be another syllable there\]

### thisiss Transcription Before Audio Clean Up

i can confirm it's \[ironman?\]

the time is a post somewhere \[or: the time is opposed somewhere\]

\[....\] sitting there

\[also?\] the generational divide

\[??\]

\[oh my god\] to the bitter end

\["and oh my god"\] i wish i could make sense

\[? ... ... " the children" ... ... ?\] frightened... ... ... \[? ?\]

that somehow the system is behind the code.

the truth is definitely allocated

such as \[oxygen-fipper-feen? centipede?\]

the proof \[or truth?\] is all the sound is working

\[middle-man?\]
