# EL

♐EL is a series of videos that was uploaded to the
[twitter](List_of_Series#Twitter_account "wikilink") account between
March 7 and March 12, 2016. It is the first series posted in the twitter
account and contains the first known tweet from the account
([♐EL 0](https://twitter.com/unfavorablesemi/status/707060725135646721)).

The videos in this series are in the "classic" UFSC style, three second 
long videos, with frames of a single color and the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") saying a letter or number.

## Documentation and recovery

Because the twitter account wasn't discovered until the series was
underway
[♐EL 311](http://twitter.com/unfavorablesemi/status/707115890362490880)
was the first documented tweet. This series has been partially preserved
[here.](https://mega.nz/#!Uv4zGbQC!2aRS3oh4KSQE4RfeP8jvJaOxju92kms_JRNZur0FEY4)

Discord user SaintNewts has devised a script to scrape Twitter for
additional tweets in this series, which recovered several in a slow and
meticulous process. The known tweets are tracked in this
[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ybo7GoWaon-CBw5lc54KZdvnplkk22WStMeeRolJx4Y/edit#gid=0).

As of 2017-08-29, approximately 3495 out of 4891 tweets are missing.
