## Introduction to LSTM Theory

### UFSC is the product of an LSTM Neural Network

  - Uploads began at the approximate inception of Long short-term memory
    (LSTM)
  - Some UFSC visual elements resemble the results of LSTM experiments:

![house\_generate.gif](house_generate.gif "house_generate.gif")

  - Some symbols are shared between LSTM white papers and UFSC:

  - Visualizations of the neuron 'firings' of the RNN are potentially
    related to the patterns seen in UFSC (boxes, letters, patterns,
    colors):
