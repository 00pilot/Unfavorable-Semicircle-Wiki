## Audio

The audio track begins with a clear handshake, and then around 9 seconds
of silence, before about 2 minutes and 14 seconds of loud audio. The
audio has a repeating electronic noise with other underlying sounds.
Beginning at around 48 seconds, an organ-like chord is audible and
changes tone throughout the rest of the audible track.

The audio of the [Handshake](Handshake "wikilink") has been the subject
of [further analysis](Handshake#Analysis "wikilink").

## Composite

### Details in composite

Discord user Rutabaga has observed that (similar to
♐[PORT](PORT "wikilink") and ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") ) there are
Morse-like "dots and dashes" in the top left corner of the image.

(*detail from ♐RUN composite*)

Discord user ShadowMorphyn has decoded these as "IGMENADENDNNEGOEMOOM".

## "Morse code"

Following on the analysis of dots and dashes in ♐[NODE](NODE "wikilink")
(which could be decoded as 7-bit ASCII), discord user NKC1982 made a
preliminary analysis of the dots and dashes in the top left corner:

  - The black/white pixel code in the top left of the RUN composite
    yielded some text, but nothing meaningful. Using my method of
    removing the leading black/white pair and ignoring extra bits got
    "DYL@Oe@hAb@ns@c\_oO" which I'm pretty sure is meaningless.
  - Thinking the @ symbols may be spaces, I tried rotating each byte one
    bit right and got the following text: '2 4 1 79 1/7' including the
    quote marks.

## Possible Relation to Chicxulub Crater

"The composite compared to the gravity map of the crater, where right is facing north.")

The grayscale composite shows a distinct spiral-shaped area that is
shaded darker than the majority of the image. Some of the most
identifiable features of the composite are the "panhandle" and what
looks similar to a circular impact crater. The meteor that formed the
crater is said to have caused a mass extinction event about 66 million
years ago, a disastrous event possibly being the meaning behind the
vague but worrying title "RUN."
