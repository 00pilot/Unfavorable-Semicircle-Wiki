## Overview

The original youtube account was shut down for TOS violations, and UFSC's creator(s) deliberately removed the later material.
An important part of the work on this project is ensuring that the
videos will remain available to this community and future researchers.

## Existing Archives

### Archives of videos

* An archive (large, but not complete) of the videos from the original youtube account can be found here: <http://www.mediafire.com/?94a040t5vwsprwx><br/>(*n.b. The 7zip is 300MB, but what's inside is 7.5GB, 77442 files*)

* An archive of the videos from the second youtube account can be found here: <https://mega.nz/#F!ThAi2TZT!kFlgV0_JDaFeQdVWmJG7bg>

* tomasf has an archive of some videos [here](http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/videos/), including most major videos of the deleted channel as well as the deleted video [SQEN](SQEN "wikilink").

* A mirror of the 3 sources above is also available [here](https://ufsc1654.blaucloud.de/index.php/s/ldXZzjZVuLPAXS0) (note that the website is very slow but it will eventually open and allow you to download the files at normal speed, just be patient). Total mirror size is just under 2GB.

### Archives of composites

* a downloadable archive of 2D and 3D composites can be found [here](composites-2021-04-28.zip "wikilink").

## Grabbing videos from youtube

There are several ways to download the videos that are posted on
youtube.

  - [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl) is a command line
    utility for downloading videos from YouTube, Twitter, and other
    sites. It can download groups of videos by keyword or channel, and
    control the format of the video and audio it downloads in.
  - [JDownloader](http://jdownloader.org/) is a free, open-source
    download management tool which will download material in the same
    format it was uploaded.
  - Discord user spicy boy indicates that
    [ClipConverter](http://www.clipconverter.cc/) is the best online
    youtube downloader.
  - Firefox users can use add-ons such as [Download YouTube Videos as MP4](https://github.com/gantt/downloadyoutube), which integrates
    with YouTube's interface, adding a button to download YouTube videos
    directly from YouTube.
