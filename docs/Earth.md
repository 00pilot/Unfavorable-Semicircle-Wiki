## Earth

Interpretation

The earth as a separate planet has little astrological significance
because it is the position of the observer in astrology's usual
geocentric world view. The earth is represented in the geocentric chart
by the ascendant and descendant axis, which show the points of the
rising and setting sun on the horizon. The Imum Coeli shows the lowest
point of the sun's passage "under" the earth.

The heliocentric model, seldom used in astrology, does put the sun as
the observer's position, and consequently a heliocentric horoscope shows
the earth as a separate planet. However, its position is always 180
degrees opposite the sun's position in the geocentric chart.

Because astrologers seldom treat the earth as a planet in the usual
sense, it has no rulerships, dignities, or affiliations. Some
astrologers consider the earth to be a good match with Taurus, based on
its affinity with this fixed earth sign.
