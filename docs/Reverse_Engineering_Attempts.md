*This is a compendium of work done to re-create videos in the manner of
UFSC.*

# Freezepond's video

{{\#ev:youtube|<https://youtu.be/8MaRI8iq-iA>}}

This proof-of-concept video used this source picture:

![ Bering original picture.png](_Bering_original_picture.png
" Bering original picture.png")

which renders this composite:

![ Bering composite.png](_Bering_composite.png " Bering composite.png")

(Freepond notes: "The entirety of \[the source picture\] wasn't
"ufsc-ized" though just because that would make the video too long")

# Extra's videos

This video was created by discord user extra.

It creates this composite:

His notes on the process:

> i loaded up an imagine in photoshop, threw some gaussian noise at it,
> and then extracted each pixel as a single image then used a script to
> scale up each image to 50x50 and placed a random amount of pixels at a
> random amount of random points and then stitched it together with
> ffmpeg and the sound is [pocsag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POCSAG)
> i yanked off a youtube video
