## Significance

It is currently unclear if the video was removed because some sort of
fault had been observed with it by the uploader or if the very name
itself was meant to be a clue or signal and the content irrelevant.

The word "zoro" does not have any strongly-evocative associations in
area commonly associated with UFSC.

It is similar to the word "zorro", which is Spanish for "fox" (as well
as the famous swashbuckling fictional character).
