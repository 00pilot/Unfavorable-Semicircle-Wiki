## Description of videos

The videos in this series are two seconds long, with rapidly-changing
frames of a single color and the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") making a series of sounds that are not
the customary letters and numbers. Pieces of the
[Handshake](Handshake "wikilink") appear occasionally
([example](https://twitter.com/unfavorablesemi/status/743637589274464261))

This series is well-preserved, and all of the videos have been scraped.
Several composites have been made of the videos.

## Relationship with ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST "wikilink")

The image in the DEPTH composite is visually similar to the top half of
the ♐[HARVEST](HARVEST "wikilink") composite image. So far, no systemic
investigation has been made to determine whether they are exactly
similar. Likewise, it is otherwise unclear why or how the two series are
related.

## Sound analysis

The ♐DEPTH videos contains sounds that seem to be audio from other
videos chopped into smaller slices. (It has been theorized that includes
the audio from ♐[CREM](CREM "wikilink") and ♐[ZUFCHO](ZUFCHO "wikilink")
amongst others.)

[Initial analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4qpi6n/depth_videos_combined_interesting_audio/)
has indicated there are 100 discrete sounds used across the series, but
there is still work to be done finding the significance of that, such as
finding whether that comprises a codeset or if the pieces can be
arranged into a single continuous message.
