  - in "November 2017" a twitter account with this handle was
    reactivated. It is undetermined if if was reactivated by the same
    user(s) as before, or is someone else had simply "claimed" the

        deactivated twitter account 30 days after its deletion.

### Conjecture around timeline

It is open to debate whether this progression of events was deliberate
or coincidental — that is to say, was the operator(s) of the
@unfavorablesemi account waiting to be "noticed" before adding more
content?

## Meaning and interpretation

The meaning of this tweet is currently unclear. It is surmised that it
might be [base85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85) text, or
encoded by a Caesar shift (a method used in the past by UFSC).
