♐HOLDOUT is a video posted to the second youtube account on June 24,
2017. It was the first video posted on the main account since
♐[BRING](BRING "wikilink"), twenty-two days earlier. Somewhat
unusually, it is the third non-series video in a row on the main
channel.

## Description of video

The video is 1:35:05 in length, and there appears to just be a black
unmoving image.

## Audio & analysis

The audio is in mono, with a distorted "pager"-style track.

The "sound type" seemingly only changes on seconds, as if the audio is
segmented.

There is an extremely high possibility that there lies something else
among the noise.

## Significance of name and relationship to other videos

The significance of the name 'holdout' is as yet unclear.

Discord user ShadowMorphyn notes that according to [this
link](https://www.analytics-toolkit.com/glossary/holdout-group/) "A
holdout group is a group of users who are 'held back' from entering into
any experiments performed on a website and kept as a global control
group."

## Composites

There are no obvious changing frames, making a composite impossible to
create.
