# HULL

♐HULL is a video posted to the second youtube account on March 29, 2017.
It was the first video posted after a five-day break following the end
of the ♐[DUAL](DUAL "wikilink") series. It was posted about twelve hours
before the ♐[BROAD](BROAD "wikilink") series began.

## Description of video

The video is 0:20 in length. It has a series of black + white images
that resembles the "slices" on an MRI scan.

## Audio & analysis

The audio is in stereo, with a grinding data-transmission type sound.
The two channels are *nearly* identical — inverting on channel and
mixing them revels a slight difference in the last four seconds of the
video.

## Significance of name and relationship to other videos

The significance of the name 'hull' is as yet unclear. It could refer
to:

  - [the watertight body of a ship or boat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_\(watercraft\)) (*see also
    ♐[BRINE](BRINE "wikilink") and ♐[PORT](PORT "wikilink")*)
  - Cities in England, Québec and the U.S.A.
  - certain geometrical concepts (*see* [Hull disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull)) including
    [Convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) sets

The visual style seems related to that of ♐[LOVE](LOVE "wikilink") (and,
more ambiguously, to other "black & white" videos such as
♐[CREM](CREM "wikilink") and ♐[RESQEN](RESQEN "wikilink")).
