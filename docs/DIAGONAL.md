♐DIAGONAL is a video posted to the second youtube account on January 28,
2017. It was the first video posted after a three-week break on the
youtube account (♐[UPRIGHT](UPRIGHT "wikilink") was posted on January
21st) and was posted the day before two new series began:
♐[MOTH](MOTH "wikilink") (on youtube) and ♐[POINT](POINT "wikilink")
(on twitter).

## Description of video

The video is 24:30 in length. The visuals contain a flickering series of
monochrome frames. The sound is in mono, and there is no audio after the
3:30 mark.

## Audio & analysis

The isolated audio from ♐DIAGONAL can be found
[here](https://clyp.it/b5lzfn11).

When sped up to approximately the length of the opening sound from
♐[MOTH](MOTH "wikilink") (\~15 seconds) it sounds like
[this](https://clyp.it/bxdllqad).

It appears to sound like the result of exporting non-audio file data
into audacity, or layering multiple high db offset tracks onto
eachother.

## Significance of name and relationship to other videos

The significance of the name 'diagonal' is as yet unclear.

Conceptually, ♐DIAGONAL seems related to the visual style of
♐[RECOVER](RECOVER "wikilink"). Except for the fact that it was also
posted after a notable "pause" in new material from UFSC, it is unclear
if or how the two are related.

The 3-D Composite appears to show a definite constrained shape.
