## Description of video

The video is 3:23 in duration. The video contains shifting colored
pixels. It contains a mono audio track of "calliope"/ragtime music. This
video has perhaps the least distorted-sounding audio of any of the
"ragtime" tracks.

### Audio

A cleaned-up version on the ♐RETIO audio can be heard
[here](https://soundcloud.com/piecat/delock-cleaned-up). (It is
mis-titled delock, but it is actually ♐RETIO.)

## Away Down East In Maine

The original audio seems to be from a song called "[Away Down East In
Maine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_GpFDoYp4)", which was written
by [Walter Donaldson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Donaldson)
and recorded in 1922 by Miss Patricola with the Virginians. (Victor ‎–
18976, the b-side to "Lovin' Sam (The Sheik Of Alabam')").

The audio from ♐RETIO and this particular recording "Away Down East In
Maine" seem to align.

There is speculation as to whether the visuals in ♐RETIO correspond to
the changes in the song's video.
