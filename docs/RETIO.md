# ♐RETIO

♐RETIO is a video posted to the [second YouTube
account](Real_and_Fake_channels "wikilink") on March 28, 2016. It was
posted near the end of a busy period for UFSC, one day after
♐[WINGSET](WINGSET "wikilink") (and the ♐[MUL](MUL "wikilink") series
on twitter) and one day before ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink").

## Description of video

The video is 3:23 in duration. The video contains shifting colored
pixels. It contains a mono audio track of "calliope"/ragtime music. This
video has perhaps the least distorted-sounding audio of any of the
"ragtime" tracks.

### Audio

A cleaned-up version on the ♐RETIO audio can be heard
[here](https://soundcloud.com/piecat/delock-cleaned-up). (It is
mis-titled delock, but it is actually ♐RETIO.)

## Away Down East In Maine

The original audio seems to be from a song called "[Away Down East In
Maine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_GpFDoYp4)", which was written
by [Walter Donaldson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Donaldson)
and recorded in 1922 by Miss Patricola with the Virginians. (Victor ‎–
18976, the b-side to "Lovin' Sam (The Sheik Of Alabam')").

The audio from ♐RETIO and this particular recording "Away Down East In
Maine" seem to align.

There is speculation as to whether the visuals in ♐RETIO correspond to
the changes in the song's video.

## Possible relationship to ♐DELOCK/"Homesick"

It has subsequently been discovered that the music in ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") is "[*Homesick*](https://youtu.be/Mw6n1LuMaBQ)", recorded by Bailey's Lucky Seven. Like "Away Down East In Maine", it was recorded in 1922. That year is significant in terms of copyright. After the Disney/Steamboat Willie copyright extension, nothing after 1922 entered the public domain in the U.S. until recently.
