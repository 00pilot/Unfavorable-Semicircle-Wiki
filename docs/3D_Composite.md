**(*See also the [Composite visual
overview](Composite_visual_overview "wikilink").*)**

A 3D composite is created by plotting the colors of each pixel in a
[composite image](Video_Composites "wikilink") on a 3D graph, mapping
RGB values to XYZ positions.

Many of the video composites produce shapes in 3D. For example,
[BREADTH](BREADTH "wikilink") is an atom-like shape with nested spheres
of increasingly higher density, surrounded by 3 rings. And
[JALVINSACH](JALVINSACH "wikilink") has the outline of some cubes.

## Viewing 3D Composites

The "path=" file can be changed to any other .stl file on tomasf's
website:

`http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/stl.html?path=(NAME OF
COMPOSITE)_composite3D.stl`

e.g:
<http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/stl.html?path=BREADTH_composite3D.stl>

Slower, but with color and alternate viewing modes:
<https://unfavorablesemicircle.github.io/3d-viewer/>

3D composites can also be produced with MATLAB or Octave.
