# MAX TEND

♐MAX\_TEND is a video posted to the second youtube account on Jul 14,
2016. Its name is ambiguously related to
\[<https://plus.google.com/100522957117354193465/posts/KJUyUJ3xtV4>| a
post\] with the same words on the original account's G+ page.

On 2016-09-23 it was renamed to ♐MAX\_TEND MALFORM. (The day before, a
message with the same phrase appeared on the Google plus page). It
appears the name was changed around the same time
♐[RECOVER](RECOVER "wikilink") was posted.

## Description of video

The video is 27:25 in duration. The video contains a static brown frame
with pixel "fingerprint". One of the pixels is outlined in white. It
contains a mono audio track. The [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") spells out FREEBIRD3 near the
beginning. The audio track also contains a near-inaudible series of
throbbing sounds with a large amount of [DC offset](DC_offset "wikilink").

## Meaning of "FREEBIRD3"

*please expand*

The password-like "FREEBIRD3" is similar to the spelled-out "IANNOP6"
near the beginning of [DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink").
