## Astrological Links to USFC

Unfavorable Semicircle uses the astrological symbol, or glyph, for
[Sagittarius](Sagittarius "wikilink"), ♐, to prefix all video names.

Stabilitory Newing uses the astrological glyph for
[Earth](Earth "wikilink"), ⊕

No other explicit astrology symbols or terms are used in the videos.

Modern astrology avoids using judgmental words such as 'bad' or 'good'
when interpreting an [astrological chart](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Chart), so 'Unfavorable' would
not be used professionally, though it might be used as such by amateur
astrologers or anyone not familiar with [modern Western astrology](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Modern_Astrology).

The term Semicircle has no real meaning in astrology. A semicircle could
be an indirect reference to an
[aspect](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Aspect), which are angles
between two [planets](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Planet) or
points on an astrological chart. Some aspects are considered
'unfavorable', but without any context such as the planets or points
creating the aspect, the term has no real meaning. The 'semicircle'
could be an astrological pun, since the
[Semisquare](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Semi-Square) aspect is
traditionally seen to be 'unfavorable'.

### Astrological References to Look For

Any numbers in the NN°nn'nn" format, where 0\>NN\>30, and 0\>nn\>60.
That's the format astrology uses for placement of planets in a sign. Any
references to planet names and specific angles. Any
latitude/longitude/time references. You need these to calculate an
astrological chart

The videos [DUAL](DUAL "wikilink") and [BROTHER](BROTHER "wikilink")
could be oblique references to the zodiac sign
[Gemini](http://wiki.astro.com/astrowiki/en/Gemini_Gemini "wikilink"),
which is the sign in opposition to
[Sagittarius](Sagittarius "wikilink").

## Relating astrological signs to UFSC Videos

Discord users Anteater and Vomalhaut have made some connections between different videos and various astrological signs:
* [Gemini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology)) = twins (*i.e.*, [brothers](BROTHER "wikilink"))
* Sagittarius (obvious from UFSC's use of ♐, the sign's astrological symbol)
* Virgo is associated with [harvest goddess mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)), which connects to [HARVEST](HARVEST "wikilink")
* Pisces is symbolized by fish; [BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") are [a kind of fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_(fish))

Interestingly, the "houses" of Gemini and Sagittarius, as well as those of Vrigo and Pisces, are opposed to each other, drawing a series of connections.
