According to Wikipedia, "DC offset... is the mean amplitude of the
waveform. If the mean amplitude is zero, there is no DC bias. A waveform
with no DC bias is known as a *DC balanced* or *DC free waveform*.
\[...\] The term originates in electronics, where DC refers to a direct
current voltage. In contrast, various other non-DC frequencies are
analogous to superimposed alternating current (AC) voltages or currents,
hence called *AC components* or AC *coefficients*."

The audio in several UFSC videos has been observed to have a pronounced
amount of DC offset. It is unclear how this was done, or to what
purpose.

In Audacity (or a similar program) DC offset is visible as an off-centre
waveform:

## The "[Handshake](Handshake "wikilink")"

It has been observed by Discord user Risto that in at least one case,
"the handshake doesn't have an offset" when the rest of the audio does"
