♐LANYARD is a video posted to the second youtube account on May 12,
2017. It was the first video posted after a 38-day break following the
end of the ♐[BROAD](BROAD "wikilink") series. No series followed it on
the channel. However, ⊕[RATE](RATE "wikilink"), on the [stabilitory
newing](stabilitory_newing "wikilink") channel, was posted five days
after this video.

## Description of video

The video is 1:28 in length, but the visuals "freeze" at the 0:30 mark,
as does the default YouTube UI. It has a series pulsing of black + white
images that resemble a close zoom of the output an x-ray or MRI scan.

## Audio & analysis

The audio is in mono, with a grinding/warbling sound. A bass portion
appears to pulse about every two thirds of a second for most of the
video.

## Significance of name and relationship to other videos

The significance of the name 'lanyard' is as yet unclear. It could refer
to:

  - [a cord or strap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanyard) worn around
    the neck, shoulder, or wrist to carry such items as keys or
    identification cards.
      - "Aboard a ship, \[lanyard\] may refer to a piece of rigging used
        to secure or lower objects." \[This might link this video
        further to ♐[HULL](HULL "wikilink").
  - [the unsuccessful first attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-6_Lanyard) to develop and
    deploy a high-resolution optical reconnaissance satellite by the
    United States National Reconnaissance Office.

The visual style seems related to that of ♐[LOVE](LOVE "wikilink") and
♐[HULL](HULL "wikilink").

### Significance of posting time

Similar to ♐[UPRIGHT](UPRIGHT "wikilink") (which also shares a similar
"pulsating" visual quality), ♐LANYARD is unusual as it was not being
posted near the start or end of a series.
