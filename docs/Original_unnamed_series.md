# Original unnamed series

The "original unnamed series" is one (or possibly several consecutive)
series of over 48,000 videos uploaded to the first YouTube account,
starting some time after its creation on March 30, 2015. (The first
known UFSC video, ♐980708, was posted on April 5, 2015.) The videos were
named only with the Sagittarius symbol (♐) and non-consecutive numbers.

Because of the deletion of the original channel, this series is not
fully preserved. *add info on how many videos were saved/not saved*

## Characteristics of original series videos

These videos set the template for "classic" style UFSC videos. Most were
four seconds long, with a single colored frame and the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") reciting a single letter or number.

Videos with irregular audio in this series include:

  - silent videos
  - a series of fragments from the "calliope" music heard in
    ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink")
  - a "full set" of the voice reciting the full alphabet plus numbers 0
    to 9
  - "thumping" or mic bump sounds
  - smooth "thumps"
  - various glitch/distorted/sped-up data sounds
  - "brief noises"
  - "loud tones" that appear to be a streched out version of
    ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink")

These appear similar to sounds heard in later UFSC videos, although many
here are in a less-distorted form, which may make them worth further
study.

## Different "seasons"?

In [the analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/46zwat/breakdown_of_todays_findings_february_22nd_2016/)
of Reddit user u/McSweepyPants, there were several "seasons" in these
videos and the contemporaneous stand-alone videos:

  - **GENESIS: April 4th, 2015 - April 21st, 2015** This is the
    beginning of the videos. Some days videos weren't uploaded and
    details are pretty fuzzy about when they begin to talk. Per usual,
    certain day would have different colored themes. Nothing to exciting
    happens during this period, although I myself have not been able to
    look to deep into this time.
  - **LOGIC: May 26th, 2015 - May 29th, 2015** I have named this season
    LOGIC because of the fact that it is an endless string of the man
    say 1 and 0. I have not been able to look through every single video
    through that time span but from how many times i’ve clicked through
    shit, I haven’t heard anything but a 1 or a 0. This is completely
    useless though until we find a way to order these videos by date and
    having it show us the first video made within that range of dates.
      - Important note: In GENESIS, there was a very long string of 1’s
        and 0’s, like the ones in LOGIC.
  - **FUMBLE: June 12, 2015** This was given the name fumble mainly
    because it sounds like this guy is fumbling around with his mic.
    This is the only day where you hear sounds that are a little
    personal. One resembles a heart beat, another one is just of the mic
    getting flicked. They are very random and obscure.
  - **[LOCK](LOCK "wikilink"): July 17th, 2015** This is what brought us
    all together. 27 minutes of weird static noises and flashing colors.
    One of the key videos produced by this channel. Nothing much else to
    say about it.
  - **[OR](OR "wikilink"): August 10th, 2015** Videos whose length is in
    their title. The only videos that don’t have the sagittarius symbol
    in their name. There also follows a string of high-pitched
    squealling vids. They vary in length and are really fucking
    annoying.
  - **[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink"): December 26th, 2015 - December 28th,
    2015** This season is a very strange find, there are small portions
    of DELOCK uploaded in 4 second snippets until the 28th, when the
    full DELOCK video is uploaded. After this, I was unable to find
    videos until January 5th.
  - **NEON: January 5th, 2016** I named this season NEON because of the
    colors used in the background. It seems to only use very vibrant
    colors, like light greens, neon yellows, etc. The videos during
    NEON, that I saw, had no audio. They only consisted of a background.
    After the 5th, we wouldn't hear anything until February 2nd, 2016.
  - **[PER](PER "wikilink"): February 2nd, 2016** A strange and short
    vid, came shortly before the BRILL series. Seems to be almost
    animated with a purplish streak running through the picture.
  - **[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink"): February 13th, 2016 + forward**
    Reference vid This is the current series of videos, no obvious
    pattern other than the names being ordered. Sometimes things Trigger
    after 1,000 videos. QUOT was triggered between 24000 and 24001. Also
    at 27000 the background went from alternating between gray and
    different shades of red to blues and grays. There was also a 3 hour
    break that happened a few hours ago, but then it continued uploading
    as if nothing happened.
