[unfavorable
semicircle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA2j2wFhXsQej79c9V4v_Lg/)
was a youtube channel controlled by the maker(s) of UFSC. Its date of
establishment was unknown.

Within the solving community, this channel was widely viewed as a
copycat or tribute channel. However, this was listed as a "REAL" outlet
in the [fourth G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_4 "wikilink"), referred to
as "OT", possibly for "other". Because it was not assumed to be genuine
up to that point, it received mostly cursory attention. Ironically,
however, due to the inner workings of search engine indexing, this
channel (not the "main" one) was listed first in searches, and its
videos often had more views (by an order of magnitude or more) than the
original channel's videos.

This channel disappeared from youtube sometime before November 21, 2017
(when it was first noted to have been deleted), and was therefore
possibly removed in the [Reset](RESET_STRANGE_YD "wikilink").

## Distinguishing Features

Videos on this channel were titled with two leading Sagittarius symbols
("♐♐").

This channel regularly reposted older videos from UFSC (from before the
♐[BROTHER](BROTHER "wikilink") series). It's unknown whether or not
the reposted files were altered in any way.

Besides re-posting videos, this channel posted two unique videos:
♐♐[LOYAL](LOYAL "wikilink") and ♐♐[CULLET](CULLET "wikilink"). These
were originally considered to be derived from actual UFSC videos.
