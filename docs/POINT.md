♐POINT is a series of videos uploaded to the Twitter account. It began
on January 29, 2017 and stopped posting on February 13th (at
[♐POINT 5818](https://twitter.com/unfavorablesemi/status/831074953835454464)).
It was posted in parallel with the [MOTH](MOTH "wikilink") series being
posted on the second youtube account. The series was the final series
posted to Twitter before the [manual closing of the
account](RESET_STRANGE_YD "wikilink").

## Description of videos

Similar to series such as [NIL](NIL "wikilink"), the videos in this
series are four seconds long, with the [Unknown
Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") saying a letter or a number at the
beginning of the video.

## Posting Frequency

The series was posted in ten bursts, with periods of inactivity in
between. The busts were as short as 29 tweets and as long as 1488. In
most periods, one video would be posted approximately every two minutes
(with the exception of the third burst, which featured one video per
minute).

Data pertaining to the periods can be found at [Tomas'
website](http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/POINT_periods.txt).

The 3-D composite makes a roughly half-spherical shape, somewhat similar
to that of ♐[DUAL](DUAL "wikilink")'s 3-D composite. This (and other)
3-D composites are viewable

## Transcription

Using audio hashing, Thomas has [auto-transcribed the entire
series](http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/POINT_transcription.txt). It is
backed up on the wiki [here](POINT_transcription "wikilink").

shows the frequency of each character in the ♐POINT transcription,
complete to ♐POINT 5818*)

### Possible cipher data

#### Caesar cipher

Using a [Caesar Cipher](http://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher) tool,
ShadowMorphyn has found the possible references to two other UFSC videos
([LOVE](LOVE "wikilink") and [JALVINSACH](JALVINSACH "wikilink")) with a
22 character shift.

Cipher*)

#### Bifid cipher

The transcription also corresponds closely with a [Bifid
cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifid_cipher) using a 6×6 Polybius
square, according to a [cipher comparison
utility](http://bionsgadgets.appspot.com/gadget_forms/refscore_extended.html).

For more investigation, a brute force or dictionary attack can be done
using the
[CryptoCrack](https://sites.google.com/site/cryptocrackprogram/home)
utility.
