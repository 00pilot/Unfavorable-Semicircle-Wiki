## Characteristics

♐NEO is 7:58:24 long and contains a series of rapidly-flashing images.
Discord user kingrodian has noted that the video has 717614 frames.

## Audio

The file contains a stereo audio track with rapid spluttering noises for
the first seven minutes of the video, gradually increasing in speed. It
abruptly cuts off at 7:29, after which it is silent.

The audio has been passed through a low-pass filter or similar, leaving
a very distinctive "cliff" (at just under 15000Hz) visible in a
frequency analysis

## Composite

### 2-D

(*♐NEO composite as square*)

There seems to be no obvious "proper" width for this composite.

According to Discord user Tohwil, there are 6136 unique colors in the
composite. Discord user kingrodian has noted that when separating into
color channels, there is pretty much no data in blue. (Compare and
contrast with ♐[AZO](AZO "wikilink") 0, which similarly has no green.)

### 3-D

The 3-D composite for ♐NEO is visually similar to the one for
♐[AZO](AZO "wikilink") 0, looking like a "keyboard" that is nearly
flat in the third dimension. The 3-D composite for ♐NEO looks visually
similar to a tree.
