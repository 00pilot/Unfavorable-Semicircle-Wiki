Tweet #2

got it basically right. outsider art, some puzzle some arg. webdriver inspired. a fine line between comprehensible and noise. stream of conscious, vague meanings. programming project & nothing exciting. meaningless poem unfound. not sure can be. nice work to all involved!♐️

analysis

A largely straightforward comment, although the reference to the "meaningless poem unfound" is unclear.

Tweet #3

love this

plus a youtube link to the song "The Most Beautiful Day" by Professor Kliq. The lyrics of the song describe the arrival of UFO's to earth:

And once it came close enough I knew
That all these tiny little things
That all these tiny little things
That all these tiny little things
I realised that they were UFOs
I realised that we were being invaded by aliens
On the most beautiful day that I've ever seen

Discored user ShadowMorphyn posited that "that song they posted is definitely the sound for SQEN".
